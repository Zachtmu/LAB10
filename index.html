    <h1>SEO and SMO Techniques</h1>
    <section>
        <p><strong>SEO Techniques:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>1. Meta Descriptions:</strong> Meta descriptions are essential for promoting your portfolio website in search engine results. When someone searches for "graphic design portfolio" or "web developer in Toronto," a clear and compelling meta description might help your website stand out. According to Patel (2021), this strategy is particularly beneficial for personal portfolios since it allows you to concisely highlight your distinctive abilities and accomplishments. For example, a meta description like "Explore Zachary Liu's portfolio showcasing innovative graphic design, web development projects, and creative solutions" can attract potential employers or clients by demonstrating your expertise right away.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Optimized Heading Tags:</strong> Use heading tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for your name or title (e.g., "Zachary Liu - Web Designer and Developer") and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for sections like "Projects," "About Me," or "Contact" to arrange your material for both users and search engines. Killoran (2013) underlines that this layout not only makes your site easier to explore, but it also increases its exposure in search engine results. For a portfolio, this might ensure that potential clients looking for specific talents, such as "web design projects," can simply access the appropriate areas on your website.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Internal Linking:</strong> Internal linking is a great strategy to direct people through your portfolio while also enhancing your website's SEO. For example, linking a project page to your "About Me" or "Contact" section encourages visitors to spend more time studying your work, indicating value to search engines. Jerath et al. (2014) argue that smart connecting can increase engagement and make your portfolio appear more unified. You may include links like "Learn more about this project here" to take visitors to case studies or full explanations of your work.</p>

        <p><strong>SMO Techniques:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>4. Social Sharing Buttons:</strong> Adding social sharing icons to your portfolio allows visitors to easily share your work on platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. For example, if you present a unique web design project, a recruiter may share it with their network. According to Mangold and Faulds (2009), social sharing buttons can dramatically increase your reach, which is especially useful when trying to create a reputation or find freelance jobs. For a portfolio, this may mean increased visibility and new leads.</p>

        <p><strong>5. YouTube Video Integration:</strong> If you have demo films or tutorials that demonstrate your skils, integrating YouTube videos in your portfolio can boost interaction. According to Kaplan and Haenlein (2010), video content is easily shared, making it an effective tool for personal branding. For example, a video tutorial of how you constructed a website or an animated reel of your designs might capture viewers' attention and entice them to discover more about you. This may help your portfolio stand out and provide clients or employers a better understanding of your skills.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Hashtag Campaigns:</strong> Using hashtags successfully might help you market your portfolio on various social media sites. For example, publishing updates or blog entries from your website with hashtags such as #WebDesignPortfolio, #GraphicDesign, or #FreelanceDeveloper might help others find your work. Suh et al. (2010) underline that hashtags increase the visibility of information, making them an excellent method for boosting visitors to your website. You can include this into your portfolio by including a social media feed that shows postings with relevant hashtags, encouraging users to interact with your content.</p>
